Release Notes and ChangeLog for MasterSimulator
===============================================

Changelog for Version 0.6.0
---------------------------
Key focus in this release was the ability to run quite a lot of the FMU
test cases from the FMI cross-check repository. Interestingly, this 
involved reading up a bit on the standard specs and finding out, that quite
a few descriptions are a bit ambiguous or at least unclear, for example
whether the 'unit' attribute of Real-TypeDefinitions is mandatory or now.
In my opinion it is, yet Dymola doesn't write a unit... Anyhow, MasterSim
now treats it as optional and uses an undefined unit for outputs.

Also, output files are now written in standard csv-format, that can be easily 
imported into both PostProc 2 and Excel and the like. 

Here's a list of all features and bug fixes:

* Feature: Ticket #36 - Make _unit_ attribute optional in TypeDefinitions section of model description file.
* Bugfix:  Ticket #35 - Missing 'variability' attribute shouldn't prevent MasterSim from running the FMU
* Feature: Ticket #34 - Change output format to csv
* Feature: Ticket #33 - Automatic stepsize calculation when stepsize = 0
* Feature: Ticket #30 - Ensure that integration does not surpass end time point
* Feature: Ticket #27 - Automatically show log file after simulation has finished
* Bugfix:  Ticket #26 - Fix configuration/​settings name (registry/​.config file path)
* Bugfix:  Ticket #25 - Logfile cannot be opened from UI when filename contains a '.'
* Feature: Ticket #24 - Improve message output so that it is easier to grep through results
* Feature: Ticket #22 - Adjust format of step-statistics file to be usable in PostProcessing
* Feature: Ticket #21 - MasterSim should be deployed with icon files and create a .desktop file on Linux
* Feature: Ticket #20 - Iterative algorithms without time step adjustment should continue when max iters have been reached
* Feature: Ticket #19 - Improve diagnostic messages from iterative algorithms
* Feature: Ticket #18 - Add button in UI to show simulation log file
* Feature: Ticket #17 - Match timesteps in all output files
* Feature: Ticket #16 - Improve simulation log
* Feature: Ticket #15 - Boolean outputs are written to integer output file
* Feature: Ticket #14 - Improve display of project file comments on welcome page
* Feature: Ticket #13 - Add summary.txt output for regression test suite
* Feature: Ticket #11 - When loading a project, automatically analyze FMUs in the background without message window
* Feature: Ticket #10 - Enhance output of FMU analysis in UI
* Bugfix:  Ticket #9  - MasterSimUI fails to read modelDescription generated by OpenModelica 1.13.0
* Feature: Ticket #8  - Extend error test with slope check
* Bugfix:  Ticket #7  - Fix "reload project on external file change"
* Feature: Ticket #6  - Associate file extension msim with MasterSimulator user interface


Changelog for Version 0.5.3
---------------------------

* Feature: Ticket #30 - Ensure that integration does not surpass end time point
* Feature: Ticket #23 - Implement slope-based error test using history information only
* Feature: Ticket #11 - When loading a project, automatically analyze FMUs in
                        the background without message window
* Feature: Ticket #27 - Automatically show log file after simulation has finished
* Bugfix:  Ticket #26 - Fix configuration/​settings name (registry/​.config file path)
* Bugfix:  Ticket #25 - Logfile cannot be opened from UI when filename contains a .

Changelog for Version 0.5.2
---------------------------

* Feature: Ticket #20 - Iterative algorithms without time step adjustment
  should continue when max iters have been reached
* Feature: Ticket #19 - Improve diagnostic messages from iterative algorithms
* Feature: Ticket #18 - Add button in UI to show simulation log file

Changelog for Version 0.5.1
---------------------------

* Bugfix: Ticket #15: Boolean outputs are written to integer output file
  (also fixes the segfault when having booling and integer outputs)
* Feature: Ticket #16: Improve simulation log (add solver version for bug reporting)
* Feature: Ticket #17: Match timesteps in all output files (use same number precision for time points)

Changelog for Version 0.5.0
---------------------------

* Bugfix: Ticket #7: Fixed reloading of project files
  modified by external applications (editors)
* Bugfix: Ticket #9: MasterSimUI fails to read modelDescription
  generated by OpenModelica 1.13.0 (to strict error check)

New feature:

* Ticket #13: Added summary.txt output for regression test suite
  (automated regression testing is now supported and used)
* added support for whitespaces and linebreaks (encoded) in string parameters when
  specified in project file

Changelog for Version 0.4.4
---------------------------

* Bugfix: Minimum time step size is now honored by the error test
* Bugfix: Output time grid is kept fixed even for variable stepping runs

New features:

*    solver and algorithm options are now checked more thoroughly, so that
     invalid combinations are flagged during initialization
*    improved algorithm option selection, so that algorithm variants can be
     specified more clearly (see also wiki-pages on algorithms and project file)
*    the leading comment block in a project file is now preserved, so annotations
     remain there when project is edited in user interface
*    step statistics are now written to the `log/stepstats.txt` file when master
     is run with verbosity level > 1

Changelog for Version 0.4.3
---------------------------

* 32bit and 64bit Windows platforms supported
* Bugfix: Main window short cuts work again
* Bugfix: Project file format correctly written from user interface (parameter format fixed)

Changelog for Version 0.4
-------------------------

* Bugfix: when adding slaves before project had been saved already, UI got stuck
* Stability improvement: added Gauss-Jacobi initial value iteration (when FMUs are in initialization mode).

Changelog for Version 0.3
-------------------------

* User Interface is now completed to a point where definition of
  master scenarios is possible
* Project file format has changed slightly, parameter names are now
  the same as member variables in project (simplifies code maintenance)

Things you can do:

* you can add slaves
* you can define connections, even with the "same-name" auto-connection feature
* you can specify simulation parameters and run the simulation


Changelog for Version 0.2
-------------------------

* UI Implementation has progressed a lot, Simulation can be started from UI
  and solver parameters can be edited
* project file format has been extended
* translation has been updated
* slave adding/removing/editing is implemented


Changelog for Version 0.1
-------------------------

First release, so there is no changelog yet. See svn-commits for details.
