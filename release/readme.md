Release/Deployment Instruction
==============================

This subdirectory holds scripts to generate releases/deploy MasterSimulator on different platforms.
To create a release, change into the OS subdirectory and execute the `create_release.*` scripts.

For Windows you need InnoSetup installed and have to copy third-party libraries for Qt and VisualStudio
into the subdirectory VC10.
