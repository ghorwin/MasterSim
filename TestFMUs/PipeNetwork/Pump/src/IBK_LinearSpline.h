/*! This class encapsulates two data vectors containing a lookup table and linear
	interpolation functionality.

	The class LinearSpline can be thought of as a container of a tabulated function
	(containing the data points of that function in separate vectors m_x and m_y).
	In addition to the reading and writing functionality of such a container it
	provides the functionality to linearly interpolate between two data points using
	the member function value(). In order to do that efficiently the slopes between
	the points will be precalculated.

	Alternatively, a linear spline can also be generated with constant-spaced x values.
	In this case, the x-value vector does not exist, but instead the minX, maxX and
	XStep values are set.

	Use any of the setValues() functions to alter the data in the linear spline. Before
	using the linear spline for calculation, call makeSpline(). Only a successful call
	to makeSpline() will allow use of the functions value(), nonInterpolatedValue(),
	slope() and slopes().
