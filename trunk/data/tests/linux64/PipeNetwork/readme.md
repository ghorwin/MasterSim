Pipe network test
-----------------

A set of 3 hygraulic pipes connected in a cycle.

Each FMU gets a mass flux and input pressure, and computes mass flux and output pressure.
Mass flux is just fed through (to allow cyclic interconnections).

One FMU implements a pump pressure-drop vs. mass flux profile.
