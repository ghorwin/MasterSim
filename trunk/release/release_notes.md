================================================

Changelog for Version 0.3
-------------------------

* User Interface is now completed to a point where definition of
  master scenarios is possible
* Project file format has changed slightly, parameter names are now
  the same as member variables in project (simplifies code maintenance)

User Manual will be updated for release 0.4.
