The libraries IBK and DataIO are needed.

You can get them from IBK at TU Dresden, Germany.
Contact: andreas.nicolai -at- tu-dresden.de

Place the library subdirectories from the library releases into
the externals subdirectory.

For example:

IBK-4.2.0/IBK  -> should go to master-sim/trunk/externals/IBK
