	Configuration header files for IBK library
	------------------------------------------

	If you don't use the CMake build system, copy this file over to
	IBK_configuration.h and manually define all options you want to have
	enabled.

	This file should be included into every header and source file of the
	IBK lib where compilation options/macros are used.

	\warning This header file is generated from IBK_configuration.h.in, so any changes made in this file will
	be lost in the next cmake configuration.
