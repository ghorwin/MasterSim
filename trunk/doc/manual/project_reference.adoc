= Project file format

_MasterSim_ uses a single project file that describes a simulation scenario. This project file has the extension `msim` and contains all data to perform a simulation.

A second file with same name and extension `bm` may be present in the same location as the project file. This contains the graphical representation of the simulation scenario. Since the graphical network display is _purely optional_, the `bm` file can be omitted/ignored/deleted at will.

[NOTE]
====
.Future development work

Currently, research is underway within the Modelica Association Project SSP https://modelica.org/projects[System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design] to define a standard for describing simulation scenarios. In due time, when the specs are complete enough, this master simulator may support this file standard, at least for exporting and importing such data. Such a file actually merges description of the FMU connection topology and its (still optional) graphical representation into one file. However, similar to FMUs this file format is actually a zip-compressed folder structure and hence SSP-project files may no longer effectively been used in version control systems. Here, the ASCII format of the current `msim` and `bm` files is very convenient and useful.

The format is a plain-text format (UTF8-encoded) with the following content:

All comment lines before the first actual input line are recognized as the header lines. In these lines the keywords `Created:` and `LastModified:` are expected to be followed by a more or less meaningful (but not standardized) date/time string to be shown in the user interface. Other header lines are treated as project description, show in the project summary on the welcome page of the graphical user interface (see Figure <<screenshot_project_properties>>).


[NOTE]

Past the header with the description, the order of the entries/lines in the file is arbitrary.

== Simulator settings

Below is a short description of the different parameters with a format description and what values are needed. For details on where there are used and what influence they have, see section <<_master_algorithms, Master Algorithms>>.

Parameters are given as numbers followed by a unit, except for counters (iteration limit) or tolerances (which are unitless anyway).

Time step related options:

[horizontal]
tStart:: (_default=0 s_) start time point of simulation
tEnd:: (_default=1 a_) end time of simulation, must be > *tStart*
hMax:: (_default=30 min_) maximum time step size 
hMin:: (_default=1e-5 s_) lower limit of time step in adaptive-time-step mode, if time step is reduced below this limit, master stops
hFallBackLimit:: (_default=1e-3 s_) for Gauss-Seidel with time step adjustment: when time step drops below this limit, non-iterating Gauss-Seidel is used (to compensate for discontinous outputs), should be > *hMin*
hStart:: (_default=10 min_) initial time step, will be use as constant step size when not in adaptive-time-step mode.
+
TIP: If *hStart* is set to 0 in the project file, it will be computed to be 1/1000 of the simulation duration defined by (*tEnd - tStart*).

hOutputMin:: (_default=10 min_) minimim time that need to elapse before next output values are written, if communication step sizes are larger than *hOutputMin*, outputs may be skipped but the regular output intervals will be kept
outputTimeUnit:: (_default=s_) The unit to be used in for the time column (the first column) of output files
adjustStepSize:: (_default=false_) enables/disables adaptive-time-step mode, when error control mode is *ADAPT_STEP*, disablin *adjustStepSize* is an error
preventOversteppingOfEndTime:: This flag is needed for certain FMUs, which include a test against surpassing the end simulation time. This is in some cases related to time series parameters, that only last until exactly the simulation end time. Another problem is also, that rounding errors can add to a very small overshooting of the end time point. Nevertheless, well-behaving FMUs should handle overstepping gracefully. Yet, to avoid an FMU error and abort of the simulation, _MasterSim_ can adjust the last communcation interval's size such, that exactly the end time of the simulation is given to the FMU. If this flag is enabled, the last interval's step size may be adjusted, even though time step adjustment is generally disabled by flag *adjustStepSize*.


*MasterMode* (_default=GAUSS_SEIDEL_) is one of:
[horizontal]
GAUSS_JACOBI:: Gauss-Jacobi algorithm (non-iterative)
GAUSS_SEIDEL:: Gauss-Seidel algorithm (iterative or non-iterative depending on *it_max_steps*)
NEWTON:: Newton algorithm with difference-quotient approximation to Jacobi matrix

Iteration and convergence parameters:
[horizontal]
maxIterations:: (_default=1=disabled_) max. number of iterations, if == 1 no iteration is done
absTol:: (_default=1e-5_) absolute tolerance for convergence/error test
relTol:: (_default=1e-6_) relative tolerance for convergence/error test

*ErrorControlMode* (_default=NONE=disabled_) is one of:
[horizontal]
NONE:: no error checking and adjustment
CHECK:: - only error checking, protocols time and magnitude of exceeded error limit. Also works with FMI 1 (by using the data of the last two steps).
+
WARNING: Not implemented, yet. Do not use!
ADAPT_STEP:: implicitely enables adaptive-time-step mode and adjusts time step when error limit is exceeded


=== Advanced settings
The following settings are mostly needed for use with cross-check procedure.

[horizontal]
preventOversteppingOfEndTime:: (_default=true_) even for constant-step FMUs, truncate the final step to hit the end time point exactly (needed for some FMUs who have strict end time checking)
writeInternalVariables:: (_default=false_) Also writes variables with local/internal causality (when set to *no*, only variables with causality _output_ are written)

Depending on the selected options, certain capabilities must be supported by the FMUs, see section <<_master_algorithms, Master Algorithms>>.


== Simulator/Slave Definitions

Each slave is defined by:

----
simulator  <priority> <cycle>  <slave-name> <html-color-code> <path/to/fmu-file>
----

The *cycle* indicates whether slave belongs to a cycle with other FMUs. *slave-name* must be a unique identifier for the slave (see discussion in section <<_master_algorithms, Master Algorithms>>).

NOTE: The *priority* is used to select order of execution within a cycle (for Gauss-Seidel). However, this feature is currently not implemented and slaves within the same cycle are evaluated in the order they are defined.

The slave/simulator name is a unique identifier of the FMU instance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Slave names *must not* contain spaces or dots. If a slave name contains a space or a dot, the parser of the project file will state that the simulator definition line is invalid. Also, slave names are used for directory names (target directories for slave-specific output). Hence, they must not contain characters that are not allowed in file system names.
====



The *html-color-code* is a typical html color definition, beginning with a hash character and then either 8 or 6 characters, for example: `#ff00ff00` or `#00ff00` for green. In the 8 character format, the first hex number is the alpha value (opaqueness - ff = fully opaque, 0 = fully transparent). Currently, there is no use for this value in the user interface, so the 6 character variant is the typical choice.

Last argument in the line is the file path reference to the actual FMU file. The path to FMU file must be enclosed in double-quotes, if the path or filename contains spaces. The path can be absolute or relative to the `msim` project file. Several slaves can be instantiated from the same FMU file (if the FMU supports this feature). In this case, several simulator lines reference the same FMU file path.

=== CSV FileReader Slaves

Instead of an FMU, you can also reference a data file (extension `tsv` or `csv`). In this case, _MasterSim_ will instantiate FileReader slaves and the data in the file is treated like an FMU that provides only output, but has no input and no parameters.

_MasterSim_ actually supports two flavours of csv files. In both variants, numbers are always written in *english number notation*. The file parser first attempts to use the tab-separated value flavour by splitting the first two lines at the tab characters. If this yields more than two columns and the same nummber of columns in both lines (the header and first data line), a tab-separated csv/tsv flavour is assumed. Otherwise, the Excel-type quoted-csv flavour is assumed.

==== Tab-separated values

The format of such an input file follows the same conventions as the file format supported by https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/postproc[PostProc2].

The file starts with a single line (the header), identifying variable name and unit in format like:

    Time [<time unit>] <tab> <var1 name> [<unit>] <tab> <var2 name> [<unit>]

where `<tab>` is the tabulator character.

    Time [d]  <tab>  T_lab [C]  <tab>  T_sample [C]  <tab>  RH_lab [%]

Example file:

    Time [h]     T_lab [C]     T_sample [C]     RH_lab [%]
    0            20            20.2             46
    0.5          20.1          20.3             43
    1.0          22            25               40
    3.0          19            15               65

The variable names are the strings in the header line excluding the units (if given). In the example above, the file would provide output variables of with names **T_lab**, **T_sample** and **TH_lab**.

[TIP]
====
A file with this format is automatically obtained if a table with such data is copied & pasted from Libreoffice-Calc/Excel/... into a plain text editor.
====

==== Comma-separated with quotes

In such a file the separation character is the , (comma), and values are quoted using double-quotes. For example:

    "time","T_lab [C]","T_sample [C]","RH_lab [%]"
    "0","20","20.2","46"
    "0.5","20.1","20.3","43"
    "1.0","22","25","40"

=== Time points and time unit 

The time points can be spaced at arbitrary intervals. _MasterSim_ currently expects simulations to run in seconds as base time unit. That means, internally, variables are exchanged matching a simulation time in seconds. When an input file defines a different unit for time, _MasterSim_ converts these times into seconds.

The following time units are recognized by MasterSim:

* ms - milliseconds
* s - seconds
* min - minutes
* h - hours
* d - days
* a - years (regular years, 365 regular days, no leap year/day)

[NOTE]
====
.Default time unit is seconds
In case of missing time unit in the header of the first column, _MasterSim_ currently implies unit **seconds** (s).
====

=== Interpretation of data provided in FileReader slaves

Variables without given units, i.e. the [...] is missing in the column captions, are assigned an unknown/undefined unit '-'.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The variables exported from such a FileReader slave have not yet data types assigned. During the initialization, _MasterSim_ looks at the connections made to FileReader slave variables and assigns data types to the variables based on the _connected input variable_.
====

During simulation, when the FileReader slave is asked to provide a value for a variable, the following rules apply.

==== *Boolean*, *Integer* and *Enumeration* values
For *Boolean*, *Integer* and *Enumeration* values no interpolation is done. Values are returned constant until the value is defined to change. Example:

----
Time [s]   Value [-]
 1         4
 3         4 <1>
 3         7 <2>
 6         4
----
<1> Value at end of interval ending at time 3
<2> Value at begin of interval beginning at time 3, this value shall be used from t>=3.

Evaluation of these values yields:

 v(1) = 4
 v(2) = 4
 v(2.99999) = 4
 v(3) = 7
 v(4) = 7
 v(5.99999) = 7
 v(6) = 4

Thus, the line `3     4` could have been omitted from the file.

==== Real values

*Real* values are linearly interpolated. For the data example above, real values would be evaluated as follows:

----
 v(1) = 4
 v(2) = 4
 v(2.99999) = 6.99999 <1>
 v(3) = 7
 v(4) = 6 <2>
 v(5.99999) = 4.00001
 v(6) = 4
----
<1> When duplicate time points are found, the second overwrites the first, so that the line `3   4` is ignored. Hence, evaluation of values in the interval 2...3 is also done with linear interpolation.
<2> The linear interpolation between values v(3)=7 and v(6)=4 at t=4 yields 6.

TIP: If you want to emulate step functions with *Real* values, just use a very short change interval, for example `v(1) = 4; v(2.9999) = 4; v(3) = 7`. _MasterSim_ will still see the linear slope between t=2.9999 and 3, but that may be insignificant to the results.

Naturally, for *string* parameters linear interpolation is not possible, thus they are handled similarly as *integer* values.

[TIP]
====
If you use an adaptive step algorithm in _MasterSim_, you should set the maximum time step/communication interval length to a value that is less than your smallest time interval in your FileReader slave input file. Otherwise, _MasterSim_ may adjust time steps to a larger value and jump over an interval/value, hereby missing information and likely generating wrong results. For example: if you work with hourly climatic data, choose 30 minutes as maximum communication interval length.
====

== Connection graph 

The connection graph defines data exchange between slaves. Each graph definition line defines the data transfer from one output variable to one input variable.

Definition syntax:

----  
graph <outputvar> <inputvar> [<offset> <scale factor>]
----

Output and input variables are composed of slave name and variable name:

----
graph <slave-name>.<variable-name> <slave-name>.<variable-name>  [<offset> <scale factor>]
----

The offset and scale factor define a transformation operation between the output variable and the value given to the input variable. If such a transformation is assigned to a connection, always both values must be present.

The following transformation equation is applied:

  input = offset + scale * output

If, for example, an FMU slave 'Sensor' delivers a temperature in Kelvin, and another FMU slave 'Heater' takes a temperature in degree Celsius, you could define the connection as follows:

 graph  Sensor.temperature  Heater.temperature  -273.15  1
 
which will result in 

 input (in C) = -273.15 + 1 * output (in K)
 
Similarly, you can invert the sign of a connection, when you, for example, connect heat or mass flows across pipes. Suppose heat flow is defined positively into a surface and you connect 'SurfaceA.HeatFlow' and 'SurfaceB.HeatFlow', the connection with sign inversion is defined as:

 graph  SurfaceA.HeatFlow  SurfaceB.HeatFlow  0  -1


=== FMU Parameters

You can set parameters of FMUs (or more specifically of the individual FMU slaves/instances) by using the `parameter` keyword.

Definition syntax:

----
parameter <slave-name>.<variable-name> <value>
----

For *boolean* parameters you have to specify `true` (case-sensitive!) for *true*, or any other value (for example `false`) for *false*.

For *integer* values you specify simply the value as number.

Values for *Real* parameters are expected in the unit defined for the respective parameter in the `modelDescription.xml` file. Unit conversion is *not* supported here.

For *string* parameters, everything after the variable name is taken as string (until end of line). Example:

 parameter building_model.projectFile C:\\My projects\\p2\\This tall building.project

Whitespaces can be included, but backspaces need to be encoded as `\\`. Line breaks have to be encoded with `\n`, as in the following example:

 parameter building_model.configPara First line\n    Some more lines with indentation\nlast line.

Will set the string:

 First line
     Some more lines with indentation
 last line

[NOTE]
====
Because of the rather simple string encoding, you cannot define a string that starts with a whitespace character.
====



== BlockMod - Network Representation File Format

The `bm` file is a simple xml file and describes the graphical layout and visualization of the modeled simulation scenario.

A simple network like

.Example for a simple graphical representation of a network
image::bm_network_example.png[Blockmod Network Example]

is defined in the following BlockMod network representation file:

[source,xml]
.Blockmod network representation file
----

				<Segment>
					<Orientation>Vertical</Orientation>
					<Offset>-48</Offset>
				</Segment>
			</Segments>
		</Connector>
	</Connectors>
</BlockMod>
----

The format is pretty self-explanatory. The first and last segment are defined automatically depending on the socket position on the block and are hence not stored in the network representation file.

[TIP]
====
https://github.com/ghorwin/BlockMod[BlockMod] is an open source library for modeling such networks. The wiki page of the project contains more in-depth information on the data format and functionality.
