= Introduction and basic concepts

_MasterSim_ is a co-simulation master program that supports FMI co-simulation. If you are new to co-simulation in general, or not yet familiar with the Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI), I suggest reading up a bit on the basics on the https://fmi-standard.org[fmi-standard.org] webpage.

Basically, _MasterSim_ couples different simulation models and exchanges data between simulation slaves at runtime. The following Figure illustrates the program organisation and the basic data flow.

== Program parts
_MasterSim_ consists of a two parts:

a. graphical user interface (GUI) and 
b. a command line simulator program _MasterSimulator_

The GUI makes it very easy to generate, adjust, modify simulation projects. A simulation project is stored in two files, the _MasterSim_ project file and the graphical representation file. The latter is optional and not needed for the simulation.

The simulation is executed by the command line program _MasterSimulator_, which reads the project file, imports referenced FMUs and run the simulation. The generated results, both from _MasterSimulator_ itself and possibly from slaves are then used by any post processing tool (like https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/postproc[PostProc 2]) to visualize and analize results.

The separation between user interface and actual simulator makes it very easy to use _MasterSim_ in a scripted environment, or for systematic variant analysis as described below in section <<_workflows,Workflows>>.

== Supported FMU types

- FMI for Co-Simulation version 1
- FMI for Co-Simulation version 2, including support for getting/setting states

No asynchronous FMU types supported.

On Linux and MacOS _MasterSim_ is typically only built as 64-bit application. On Windows, MasterSim is available as 32-bit and 64-bit application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For 32-bit FMUs use a 32-bit build, for 64-bit FMUs use a 64-Bit version. Mixed FMU platform types (32-Bit and 64-Bit) are not supported.
====

== Design criteria/key features

- cross-platform: Windows, MacOS, Linux
- no dependency on externally installed libraries, all source included in release, especially no dependency on FMI support libraries (exception: standard C++, and the Qt 5 libraries); checking out source code and building it should be easy (also packaging for different platforms)
- complete master functionality wrapped in library _MasterSim_ usable by command line tools and GUI applications
- message handling wrapped to support GUI integration and log file support, no direct `printf()` or `std::cout` statements
- supports FMU debugging: can disable unzipping (persistant dll/so/dylib files), source access allows debugging runtime loading of shared libraries and attaching debuggers
- high-level C++ code (readible and maintainable)
- includes instrumentation to retrieve counters and timers for benchmarking performance of master algorithms and FMUs
- code tailored for master algorithm debugging - all variables in type-specific arrays for _easy analysis in debugger_

See chapter <<_features_assisting_in_fmu_development_and_debugging, Features assisting in FMU development and debugging>> for details about functionality that are particularly important for FMU developers and for debugging problems with the co-simulation.

=== Special features of _MasterSim_

There is one specific feature of _MasterSim_ that is helpful for using FMUs that write their own output data. To provide a writable, _slave-specific_ output directory to each slave, _MasterSim_ sets the parameter `ResultsRootDir` (typically with value reference 42) in each slave to this directory. As long as a slave defines such a parameter, the FMU code can rely on getting a valid directory to write its data into. See also section <<_directory_slaves, Directory 'slaves'>>.

== Terminology

The following terms are used in the manual and also in the naming of classes/variables:

[horizontal]
FMU:: describes the fmu archive including model description and shared libraries
slave/simulator:: describes a simulation model that is instantiated/created from an FMU; there can be several slaves instantiated by a single FMU, if the capability *canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess* is set to true
master:: describes the overall simulation control framework that does all the administrative work
simulation scenario:: defines a set of slaves and their connections (data exchange), as well as other properties such as start and end time, algorithm options, output settings; alternatively called *system*
graph network:: another description for the topology of interconnected slaves
master algorithm:: describes the implementation of a mathematical algorithms that advances the coupled simulation in time; may include an iteration scheme
error control:: means local error check (step-by-step based), used for time step adjustment scheme
master time:: time of master simulation, starts with 0; unit is not strictly defined (needs to be common agreement between FMUs, typically in seconds, with exception of using file reader slaves, see section <<_csv_filereader_slaves,CSV FileReader Slaves>>).
current (master) time:: the time that the master state is at, changes *only* at end of successful `doStep()` or  `restoreState()` calls.

== Workflows

As with any other simulation models, most workflows involve a variant analysis. In the context of co-simulation, such variants are often created by modifying FMUs and their paramters. _MasterSim_ includes functionality to streamline such workflows.

[TIP]
====
Many workflows involve repeated execution of _MasterSim_ with little or no modifications in the project file. Sometimes it is very convenient to use the same project file and modify it, but specify a different working directory (where outputs are stored), so that the results of different variants can be compared +
(see `--working-dir` command line argument described in section <<_workingoutput_directory, Working/output directory>>).
====

=== Initial setup of a simulation scenario

This is a straight-forward procedure:

. import all FMUs and assign slave ID names
. (optional) specify parameter values for slaves
. (optional) define graphical representation of slaves
. connect output and input variables 
. set simulation parameters
. run simulation
. inspect results

=== Only published parameters of FMUs are modified

Extremely simple case and, if supported by FMUs, definitely best-practice. In _MasterSim_ only the value assigned to a published parameter needs to be changed (can be done also directly in the project file, e.g. with scripts) and the simulation can be repeated.

=== FMUs change internal behavior, but do not change interface

This is the most typical case. Here, the input and output variable names and types remain unchanged and also the published parameters remain the same. Yet, the internal behavior of the model changes due to adjustment of internal model behavior, after which the FMU is exported again. Since _MasterSim_ only references FMUs, in such cases the FMU files can simply be replaced and without any further changes the simulator can be started.

=== FMUs change parameters, but do not change inputs/outputs

In this situation, when a parameter has been configured in _MasterSim_ that no longer exists (or has been renamed), the respective definition must be changed in the project file or be removed in the user interface.

=== FMUs change interface

When an imported FMU changes part of its interface (e.g. input or output variables are modified), then this will be shown in the user interface by highlighting invalid connections. If only variable names were changed, you are best of by editing the project file and renaming the variable name there. Otherwise, simply remove the connection and reconnect. 

When the variable type changes of an input/output variable, so that an invalid connection is created (or the causality changes), then the user interface may not directly show the invalid connection. However, during initialization, the _MasterSimulator_ command line program will flag that error and abort.

== Simulation algorithm overview

_MasterSim_ has the following main building blocks:

- initialization (reading project file, extracting FMUs, checking...)
- initial conditions
- time step adjustment loop
- master algorithm (i.e. attempt to take a step)
- error checking
- output writing when scheduled

These building blocks are described below in more detail.

== Initialization

Upon start of the actual simulation (the command line program _MasterSimulator_, see section <<_command_line_arguments, Command line arguments>> for details on running the program), the working directory structure is being created and the log file writing is started.  

Then, the project file is read and all referenced FMUs are extracted. If CSV files are referenced (see section <<_csv_filereader_slaves, CSV FileReader Slaves>>), these files are parsed and prepared for calculation. 

TIP: Extraction of FMU archives can be skipped with the command line option `--skip-unzip` (see section <<_modifyingfixing_fmu_content, Modifying/fixing FMU content>>).

As first step of the actual co-sim initialzation all the FMU slaves are being instantiated (dynamic libraries are loaded and symbols are imported, afterwards `fmiInstantiateSlave()` or `fmi2Instantiate()` are called for FMI 1.0 and FMI 2.0 slaves, respectively). This is followed by a collection of all exchange variables and creation of the variable mappings.

Any error encountered during the initialization results in an abort of the simulator.

=== Initial conditions

The first task of the simulator is to get all slaves to have consistent initial values. This is already a non-trivial task and not guaranteed to succeed in all cases. The only procedure that can be employed for FMI 1 and FMI 2 slaves is to iteratively get and set output and input variables in all slaves in an iterative manner, until no changes are observed.

The algorithm in _MasterSim_ is:

----
loop over all slaves:
  - call setupExperiment() in current slave
  - set all variables of causality INPUT or PARAMETER to their
    default values as given in the modelDescription.xml
  - set all parameters to the value specified in the project file (if values are assigned)

for FMI 2: tell all slaves to enterInitializationMode()

loop with 3 iterations:
  loop over all slaves:
    get all outputs from current slave and store in global variable mapping
  loop over all slaves:
    set all input variables with values from global variable mapping

for FMI 2: tell all slaves to exitInitializationMode()
----

Note, the initial calculation algorithm is actually a Gauss-Jacobi algorithm, and as such not overly stable or efficient. 

[CAUTION]
====
If you have more than 3 slaves connected in a sequence with direct feed through of variable inputs to outputs, for example when outputs are related to inputs via algebraic relations, the 3 iterationns of the Gauss-Jacobi algorithm may not be enough to properly initialize all slaves.

However, due to an unclear specification in the FMI standard, it is not required by co-simulation slaves, to update their output state whenever input changes. Most FMUs actually only update output values in a call to `doStep()`. Therefore, with the current standard it is not possible to distinguish between a direct algebraic relation between outputs and inputs *without call* to `doStep()` and *with a call* to `doStep()`.

_MasterSim_ chooses to adopt the FMI 1.0 functionality, i.e. no iteration over steps, and only to sync inputs and outputs under the assumption, that outputs won't change (for most FMUs anyway), when inputs are set to different values. Under this assumption, 3 iterations are always enough.
====

=== Simulation start and end time

_MasterSim_ treats simulation time in _seconds_. 

TIP: If the coupled FMUs use a different time unit (i.e. years), simply use seconds in the user interface and project file and interpret the values as years.

The simulation time is entered in seconds (or any other supported unit that can be converted to seconds) in the user interface and project file. During the simulation, all time entries (start and end time, and time step sizes and size limits) are first converted to seconds and then used afterwards without any further unit conversion.

For example, if you specify an end time point of `1 h`, the master will run until simulation time 3600, which will then be sent as _communication interval end time_ in the last `doStep()` call. 

The overall simulation time interval is passed to the slaves in the `setupExperiment()` call. If you specify a start time different from 0, the master simulator will start its first communication interval at this time (the slave needs to process the `setupExperiment()` call correctly and initialize the slave to the start time point).

[WARNING]
====
The correct handling of the start time is important for all FMUs that implement some form of balancing or integration.
====

The end time of the simulation is also passed to the FMU via the `setupExperiment()` call (the argument `stopTimeDefined` is always set to `fmiTrue` by _MasterSim_).


== Time step adjustment

Once the simulation is completed, the solver enters the time step adjustment loop. If time step adjustment is disabled via flag *adjustStepSize* (see <<_simulator_settings, Simulator settings>>), the loop content will only be executed once. For FMI 1.0 slaves, or FMI 2.0 slaves without capability for storing/restoring slave states, iteration is also not possible (actually, requesting an iterative algorithm for such slaves will trigger an error during initialzation).

Within the loop, the selected _master algorithm_ tries to take a single step with the currently proposed time step size (for constant step methods, the *hStart* parameter is used). The _master algorithm_ may involve iterative evaluation of slaves (see below).

For iterative master algorithms, it may be possible that the method does not converge within the given iteration limit (see parameter *maxIterations*). 

=== Time step reduction when algorithm did not converge

If the algorithm did not converge within the given iteration limit, the communication  step size is reduced by factor 5:

  h_new = h/5

The factor 5 is selected such, that the time step size can be quickly reduced. For example, when a discontinuity is encountered (e.g. triggered through step-wise change of discrete signals) the simulator must reduce the time step very quickly to a small value, to step over the step change. 

The step size is then compared with the lower communication step limit (parameter *hMin*). This is necessary to prevent the simulation to get stuck with extremely low time steps. If the step size would be reduced below the *hMin* value, the simulation **will be aborted** with an error message.

In some cases, the interaction between two slaves may prevent any master algorithm to converge (even the Newton algorithm). Still, in these cases the remaining error may be insignificant and the simulation can tip-toe with small steps over the problematic time and increase steps afterwards. For such cases, you can specifiy the parameter *hFallBackLimit*, which must be larger than *hMin*. If h is reduced to a value below this _acceptable_ communication step size, the master algorithms will return succesfully after all iterations have been done. Thus, the step is treated as _converged_ and the simulation progresses to the next interval.

The publication mentioned above illustrates the behavior of the simulation using these parameters.

=== Error control and time step adjustment

If an error test method (*ErrorControlMode*) is set, a converged step is followed by a local error check. Currently, this error check is based on the step-doubling technique and as such can only be applied if the slaves support FMI 2.0 setting/getting of state functionality.

Basically, the check is done as follows:

-----
- reset slave state to begin of current communication interval
- take two steps (with full master algorithm per step)
- compute error criteria 1 and 2
- reset states back to state after first master algorithm
-----
[NOTE]
====
So, the error test requires two more runs of the _master algorithm_ per communication step. For iterative master algorithms, or the Newton algorithm, the overhead for error tests can be significant.
====

The mathematical formulas and calculation details of the error check are documented in publication: 

Nicolai, A.: _Co-Simulation-Test Case: Predator-Prey (Lotka-Volterra) System_ (see https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim/documentation.php[MasterSim Documentation Webpage]).

The error check uses the parameters `relTol` and `absTol` to determine an acceptable difference between the full and half-step (or their slopes). Depending on the local error estimate, two options exist:

- the local error estimate is small enough and the time step will be enlarged,
- the error check failed; the step size will be removed and the entire communication step will be repeated

[TIP]
====
If you use an error checking algorithm in _MasterSim_, you should set a fallback time step limit. Otherwise, _MasterSim_ may try to resolve the dynamics of the step change by adjusting the time steps to extremely small values.
====


== Master algorithms

A _master algorithm_ is basically the mathematical procedure to advance the coupled simulation by one step forward. Such a co-simulation master algorithm has a characteristic set of rules on how to retrieve values from one FMU, when and how these values are passed on to other FMUs, whether this procedure is repeated and the criteria for convergence of iterations.

_MasterSim_ implements several standard algorithms. A detailed discussion of the different algorithms and how the choice of algorithm and parameters affect results can be found in the following publication:

Nicolai, A.: _Co-Simulations-Masteralgorithmen - Analyse und Details der Implementierung am Beispiel des Masterprogramms MASTERSIM_, http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-319735 (in german)

=== Gauss-Jacobi ===

Basic algorithm:

-----
loop over all slaves:
  retrieve all output values

loop over all slaves:
  set all input values
  tell slave to take a step
-----

Gauss-Jacobi is always done without iteration (wouldn't make sense with iteration).


=== Gauss-Seidel ===

Basic algorithm:

-----
iteration loop:
  loop over all slaves:
    set input values for slave from global variable list
    tell slave to take a step
    retrieve output from current slave
    update global variable list
  perform convergence check
-----

=== Newton ===

Basic algorithm:

-----
iteration loop:
  in first iteration, compute Newton matrix via difference-quotient approximation

  loop over all slaves:
    set all input values
    tell slave to take a step
  
  loop over all slaves:
    retrieve all output values

  solve equation system
  compute modifications of variables
  
  perform convergence check
-----


== Output writing

Outputs are written after each completed step, but only if the time since last output writing is at least as long as defined in parameter *hOutputMin*.

TIP: If you really want outputs after each internal step, set *hOutputMin* to 0.
