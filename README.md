# About MasterSim ...

_MasterSim_ is an FMI Co-Simulation master and programming library. It supports the 
Functional Mock-Up Interface for Co-Simulation in Version 1.0 and 2.0. Using the functionality of 
version 2.0, it implements various iteration algorithms that rollback FMU slaves and increase stablity of coupled simulation.

_MasterSim_ is actively maintained/developed at the TU Dresden, Institut f√ºr Bauklimatik.

The main webpage of _MasterSim_ is https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/mastersim.

## Quick Overview

The _MasterSim_ user interface allows importing of slaves and graphically routing input/output variables:
