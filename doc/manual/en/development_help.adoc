= Features assisting in FMU development and debugging

This section describes some of the features of _MasterSim_, that are particularly useful for developers of own FMUs or to identify calculation problems with third-party FMUs.


== Modifying/fixing FMU content

If an FMU has an invalid `modelDescription.xml` file, the process of unpacking the FMU, fixing the file, packing the FMU again and re-trying the simulation with a co-simulation master may be time consuming. With _MasterSim_ you run the simulation once and get the FMU extracted in the respective `fmus` subdir. There, you can inspect all files and fix errors, or add missing files. 

Next time you run _MasterSimulator_, pass the command line option `--skip-unzip` and _MasterSim_ will skip over the unzip step and directly access the files in the extraction directory.
