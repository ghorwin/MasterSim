= Introduction and basic concepts

_MasterSim_ is a co-simulation master program that supports FMI co-simulation. If you are new to co-simulation in general, or not yet familiar with the Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI), I suggest reading up a bit on the basics on the https://fmi-standard.org[fmi-standard.org] webpage.

Basically, _MasterSim_ couples different simulation models and exchanges data between simulation slaves at runtime. The following Figure illustrates the program organisation and the basic data flow.

== Program parts
_MasterSim_ consists of a two parts:

a. graphical user interface (GUI) and 
b. a command line simulator program _MasterSimulator_

The GUI makes it very easy to generate, adjust, modify simulation projects. A simulation project is stored in two files, the _MasterSim_ project file and the graphical representation file. The latter is optional and not needed for the simulation.

The simulation is executed by the command line program _MasterSimulator_, which reads the project file, imports referenced FMUs and run the simulation. The generated results, both from _MasterSimulator_ itself and possibly from slaves are then used by any post processing tool (like https://bauklimatik-dresden.de/postproc[PostProc 2]) to visualize and analize results.

The separation between user interface and actual simulator makes it very easy to use _MasterSim_ in a scripted environment, or for systematic variant analysis as described below in section <<_workflows,Workflows>>.

== Supported FMU types

- FMI for Co-Simulation version 1
- FMI for Co-Simulation version 2, including support for getting/setting states

No asynchronous FMU types supported.

On Linux and Mac, MasterSim is typically only built as 64-bit application. On Windows, MasterSim is available as 32-bit and 64-bit application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For 32-bit FMUs use a 32-bit build, for 64-bit FMUs use a 64-Bit version. Mixed FMU platform types (32-Bit and 64-Bit) are not supported.
====

== Design Criteria/Key Features

- cross-platform: Windows, MacOS, Linux
- no dependency on externally installed libraries, all source included in release, especially no dependency on FMI support libraries (exception: standard C++, and the Qt 5 libraries); checking out source code and building it should be easy (also packaging for different platforms)
- complete master functionality wrapped in library _MasterSim_ usable by command line tools and GUI applications
- message handling wrapped to support GUI integration and log file support, no direct `printf()` or `std::cout` statements
- supports FMU debugging: can disable unzipping (persistant dll/so/dylib files), source access allows debugging runtime loading of shared libraries and attaching debuggers
- high-level C++ code (readible and maintainable)
- includes instrumentation to retrieve counters and timers for benchmarking performance of master algorithms and FMUs
- code tailored for master algorithm debugging - all variables in type-specific arrays for _easy analysis in debugger_

See chapter <<_features_assisting_in_fmu_development_and_debugging, Features assisting in FMU development and debugging>> for details about functionality that are particularly important for FMU developers and for debugging problems with the co-simulation.

== Terminology

The following terms are used in the manual and also in the naming of classes/variables:

[horizontal]
FMU:: describes the fmu archive including model description and shared libraries
slave/simulator:: describes a simulation model that is instantiated/created from an FMU; there can be several slaves instantiated by a single FMU, if the capability *canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess* is set to true
master:: describes the overall simulation control framework that does all the administrative work
simulation scenario/system:: defines a set of slaves and their connections (data exchange), as well as other properties such as start and end time, algorithm options, output settings
graph network:: another description for the topology of interconnected slaves
master algorithm:: describes the implementation of a mathematical algorithms that advances the coupled simulation in time; may include an iteration scheme
error control:: means local error check (step-by-step based), used for time step adjustment scheme
master time:: time of master simulation, starts with 0; unit is not strictly defined (needs to be common agreement between FMUs, typically in seconds, with exception of using file reader slaves, see section <<_csv_filereader_slaves,CSV FileReader Slaves>>).
current (master) time:: the time that the master state is at, changes *only* at end of successful `doStep()` or  `restoreState()` calls.

[#_workflows]
== Workflows

As with any other simulation models, most workflows involve a variant analysis. In the context of co-simulation, such variants are often created by modifying FMUs and their paramters. _MasterSim_ includes functionality to streamline such workflows.

[TIP]
====
Many workflows involve repeated execution of _MasterSim_ with little or no modifications in the project file. Sometimes it is very convenient to use the same project file and modify it, but specify a different working directory (where outputs are stored), so that the results of different variants can be compared +
(see `--working-dir` command line argument described in section <<_workingoutput_directory, Working/output directory>>).

=== Only published parameters of FMUs are modified

Extremely simple case and, if supported by FMUs, definitely best-practice. In _MasterSim_ only the value assigned to a published parameter needs to be changed (can be done also directly in the project file, e.g. with scripts) and the simulation can be repeated.

=== FMUs change internal behavior, but do not change interface

This is the most typical case. Here, the input and output variable names and types remain unchanged and also the published parameters remain the same. Since _MasterSim_ only references FMUs, in such cases the FMU files can simply be replaced and without any further changes the simulator can be started.

=== FMUs change parameters, but do not change inputs/outputs

In this situation, when a parameter has been configured in _MasterSim_ that no longer exists (or has been renamed), the respective definition must be changed in the project file or be removed in the user interface.

=== FMUs change interface

When an imported FMU changes part of its interface (e.g. input or output variables are modified), then this will be shown in the user interface by highlighting invalid connections. If only variable names were changed, you are best of by editing the project file and renaming the variable name there. Otherwise, simply remove the connection and reconnect. 

When the variable type changes of an input/output variable, so that an invalid connection is created (or the causality changes), then the user interface may not directly show the invalid connection. However, during initialization, the _MasterSimulator_ command line program will flag that error and abort.

== Master Algorithms

A _master algorithm_ is basically the mathematical procedure to advance the coupled simulation by one step forward. Such a co-simulation naster algorithm has a characteristic set of rules on how to retrieve values from one FMU, when and how these values are passed on to other FMUs, whether this procedure is repeated and the criteria for convergence of iterations.

_MasterSim_ implements several standard algorithms.

=== Gauss-Jacobi ===

=== Gauss-Seidel ===

=== Newton ===


== Error control and time step adjustment

[TIP]
====
If you use an adaptive step algorithm in _MasterSim_, you should set a minimim time step/fallback time step that is *larger* than your "small change step". Otherwise, MasterSim may try to resolve the dynamics of the step change by adjusting the time steps to extremely small values.
