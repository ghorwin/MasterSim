/*! This class encapsulates two data vectors containing a lookup table and linear
	interpolation functionality.

	The class LinearSpline can be thought of as a container of a tabulated function
	(containing the data points of that function in separate vectors m_x and m_y).
	In addition to the reading and writing functionality of such a container it
	provides the functionality to linearly interpolate between two data points using
	the member function value(). In order to do that efficiently the slopes between
	the points will be precalculated.

	Alternatively, a linear spline can also be generated with constant-spaced x values.
	In this case, the x-value vector does not exist, but instead the minX, maxX and
	XStep values are set.

	Use any of the setValues() functions to alter the data in the linear spline. Before
	using the linear spline for calculation, call makeSpline(). Only a successful call
	to makeSpline() will allow use of the functions value(), nonInterpolatedValue(),
	slope() and slopes().

	/*! Generates the tabulated data for a linear spline from any given function.

		The resulting spline data can be queried via the function spline().
		The x and y values are stored in vectors m_x and m_y. It is possible to
		populate these vectors with initial points along the spline. When calling
		generate() the argument continueIter can then be set to true to build
		the spline based on these initial points. This can be useful if points are
		requested at certain locations.

		After the generate() function has completed, the m_x and m_y values hold
		the generated coordinates. It is possible to inspect the result and, for example,
		refine the spline by calling generate() again with more strict tolerance settings.

		The spline generation algorithms attempts to produce a spline with similar interpolation
		accuracies in each interval at the end of each iteration. If the spline generation
		process stops because a maximum number of points has been exceeded, all intervals will
		have been refined approximately similarly often.

		In each step of the generation procedure all intervals are inspected and the interpolated
		value at the center point of the interval is compared with the correct function value
		at this point. If the difference exceeds the allowed absolute tolerance
		a new point is calculated and inserted at the middle of the interval. This procedure is
		repeated for all intervals, until the tolerance is nowhere exceeded.
		After each step all intervals are checked again and all points are removed
		than can also be calculated via linear interpolation within the given tolerance.
		The result is a spline that contains just as many points as necessary to
		calculate any point in the given range of the spline with the required tolerance.

		\return				The algorithm finishes either if spline was created with desired
							accuracy (return value LinearSplineGenerator::SG_Ok) or finishes
							early when number of spline points is exceeded (return value
							LinearSplineGenerator::SG_MaxPointsExceeded).

		\param f			The orignal function encapsulated in a function object derived from ScalarFunction.
		\param xMin			The lower bound for the range of x coordinates. If continueIter is true,
							the minimum of xMin and the smallest x-value from the m_x vector is being used.
		\param xMax			The upper bound for the range of x coordinates. If continueIter is true,
							the maximum of xMax and the largest x-value from the m_x vector is being used.
		\param absTol		The absolute tolerance allowed in the final spline.
		\param relTol		The relative tolerance allowed in the final spline.
		\param maxPoints	What is the maximum number of points in the final spline. If exceeded
							the function will return with the return code 1.
		\param continueIter	If set to true, the vectors x and y are not emptied but the generation continues
							for the given intervals in the vector. This can be used to monitor the progress
							of the spline generation from within GUI tools.
