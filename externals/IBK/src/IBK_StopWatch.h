/*! The StopWatch class can be used to measure the time used during execution of
	certain program parts.
	Every StopWatch object remembers its time and state. So you can use several
	stop watches simultaneously (for instance a global watch and a watch for
	certain subroutines).

	\code
	StopWatch w;
	someLengthyFunction();
	std::cout << w.diff_str() << " needed for execution of someLengthyFunction()" << std::endl;
	\endcode

	\note This stopwatch can be used also for OpenMP parallelized code. On Unix-Systems
	it uses gettimeofday().

	We use the P-impl pattern to hide the plattform specific includes and code from
	users.

	Interval functionality:
	\code
	StopWatch w;
	// set notification interval in seconds
	w.setIntervalLength(10);
	// start lengthy function
	while (true) {
		if (w.intervalCompleted())
			std::cout << "Still busy..." << std::endl;

		// ...
	}
