	There is always a central unit list in the program which will be initialized
	with a default set of units. Use any of the read() functions to replace/add units.
	A unit list can be written to a file using the write function. The member function
	convertible_units() can be used to create a vector of units that can be converted in
	or from each other. The member functions relate_units() and convert() are useful
	if you want to implement a container, such as UnitVector.
