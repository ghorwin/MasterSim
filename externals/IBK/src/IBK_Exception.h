/*! This is the general exception class used when exceptions are throwns from IBK classes and functions.
	Use this class instead of the standard library exception classes.

	When throwing an exception from within a function, pass a message text and an information about
	the location. The following code shows an example for an exception throw from within a function
	splineCheck().
	\code
	if (spline.empty())
		throw IBK::Exception("Spline must not be empty!", "splineCheck()");
	\endcode

	If you catch and re-throw an exception, also pass the old exception to build up the exception stack.
	\code
	try {
		// some code
		splineCheck();
	}
	catch (const IBK::Exception & ex) {
		throw IBK::Exception(ex, "Error initializing module!", "checkAll()");
	}
	\endcode

	You can access the exception list by using the member function msgs() and process
	the individual messages stored in the msg_info struct.
