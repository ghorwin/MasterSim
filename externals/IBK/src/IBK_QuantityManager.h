/*!	The class QuantityManager manages definitions of physical quantities.

	A list of known quantities can be read from file/string similarly to the unit list
	and then the properties of the different quantities can be retrieved.
	The Quantity manager provides conversion functionality between Quantities ID strings,
	and enumeration values of a defined subset of quantities.

	A quantity is uniquely identified through its type and ID-name.

	The QuantityManager combines the functionality of a manager for all quantities and
	for a subset of quantities actually used in any application.
