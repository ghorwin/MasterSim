/*! Standard implementation of a notification handler to be used by
	DATAIO input/output routines.

	It prints a progress bar for operations that know the length of
	the operation (like reading a file), or an animated character.
	Setting the parameter m_quiet to true disables all output to console.

	You can use this notification handler also in own code. When calling
	the notify() function without argument, it prints the string in
	m_process followed by a character that changes in sequence with each
	subsequent call.

	Calling notify with a number between 0 and 1 prints the string in
	m_process and afterwards a progress bar, if there is enough space
	(line length is limited to 75 characters).
