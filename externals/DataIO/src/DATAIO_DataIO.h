/*! \brief This class stores all output data from a Delphin output file.

	DataIO containers hold results from transient simulations. Hence, data is stored for different time points.
	For each time index, which corresponds to a certain time point, a number of values is stored
	(i.e. a time slice of the data). For field
	and flux outputs (see DATAIO::DataIO::T_FIELD an DATAIO::DataIO::T_FLUX) each value is associated to
	a spatial location. The mapping is done through the data in the corresponding geometry file, see DATAIO::GeoFile.

	Reading and writing of complete DataIO containers is done through member functions read() and write(). These functions
	read and write data in binary mode and are very fast. When the original file is present in ASCII encoding, the data is
	read as set of lines containing the actual data. When writing large data sets incrementally
	(when the simulation progresses), the output file stream is first opened
	using writeHeader() and afterwards data is appended with appendData().

	The main documentation page of the DataIO library contains examples on the principal usage of the DataIO class:
	see \ref intro_sec
