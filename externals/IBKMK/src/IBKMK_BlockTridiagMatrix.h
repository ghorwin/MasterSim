/*! Implementation of a block-tridiagonal matrix including
	block-based Thomas algorithm for solution of linear equation systems.
	The block-tridiagonal matrix implementation is meant to simplify usage by
	providing access based on lower, main or upper band. The sub-matricies
	are then stored in column-based order.

	The block-tridiag matrix is designed as variable size container, meaning
	that the sizes of the sub-matricies are defined during runtime. However,
	the time-critical portions (LU factorization and backsolution) are implemented
	using specialized versions based on sub-matrix sizes.

	Internally, the data in the matrix is stored in a continuous memory array of size
	3*n*m, with the elements of the lower band first, then the elements of the main band
	and last the elements of the upper band.

	\warning The lu() and backsolve() routines can use SUNDIALS implementations internally, select this via
			compile-time define.
	If the pivot vector is empty, the non-pivoting factorization routines are used,
	otherwise the pivoting version of the factorization routines are used. If you want to
	use the non-pivoting version of the matrix, clearPivots() after resizing/creating
	the matrix. Mind that the pivot vector is resized/recreated in a call to resize().
