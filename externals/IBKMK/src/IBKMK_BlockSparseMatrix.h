/*! Class for block sparse matrix storage in Ellpack-Itpack format (IBK-type).
	Data storage is similar to the Ellpack-Itpack format, but with special definitions
	regarding the index table. Each row of the sparse matrix can only hold as much as
	m_blocksPerRow blocks and at minimum one non-zero blocks which must be the main diagonal.
	Total size of the matrix in memory can be m_n*m_blocksPerRow elements.

	Instead of scalar values, the BlockSparseMatrix holds blocks (square matrices) instead.
	Index vector, however, remains the same as for scalar matrices. Thus, size of m_data and
	m_index are no longer the same.

### Ellpack-Itpack Sparse Matrix Format Description ###

Matrix has dimensions n x m, with m being the number of non-zero elements per row.
A matrix

	[  1   2          ]
	[  3   4   5      ]
	[      6   7      ]
	[  8   9  10      ]
	[     11  12  13  ]

will be represented by n=5, m=3

	A     = [ 1 2 0   3 4 5   6 7 0   8 9 10   11 12 13 ]
	index = [ 0 1 1   0 1 2   1 2 2   0 1  2    1  2  3 ]

The index for missing elements should be the preceding index and the corresponding
element must be zero.

Mind that instead of scalars the data vector ususally contains submatrices/blocks of
size m_nSubMatrix*m_nSubMatrix in column-major order.
