# Validated Cross-Check FMUs

Only those subdirectories are added to subversion, that contain validated (passed) or rejected msim projects. The latter must contain a 'rejected' file with some meaningful explanation why the test case was omitted.
For those cases where MasterSim cannot (and will not in future) pass the test, you can add a file 'failed' in the subdirectory with an explanation why MasterSim cannot/will not pass this test.
