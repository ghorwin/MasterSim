This directory holds the release versions of third-party libraries.

In order to keep the subversion repository small, please refrain from
updating these binary files too often.

The extracted source code of the libraries needs to be placed in
the *externals* subdirectory. See readme file in this directory.

Some of the libraries are only source for code portions, that were used
in the MasterSim library.
