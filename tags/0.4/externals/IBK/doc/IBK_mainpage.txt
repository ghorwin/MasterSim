\section intro_sec What is the IBK library?

%IBK stands for "Institut für Bauklimatik" (or institute of building climate control/climatology), a research and
teaching institute at the Technische Universität Dresden (Dresden University of Technology). It has been developed
since 2003 as library of utility classes, functions and data types that are commonly needed and used in our own
software projects.

All functions, types and symbols of the %IBK library are contained within the namespace IBK.
