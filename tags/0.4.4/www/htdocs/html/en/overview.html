<h1>About MasterSim ...</h1>
<p>
MasterSim is an FMI Co-Simulation master and <i>programming library</i>. It supports the
Functional Mockup Interface for Co-Simulation in Version 1.0 and 2.0. Using the functionality
of Version 2.0, it implements various iteration algorithms that rollback FMU slaves and
increase stablity of coupled simulation.
</p>
<p>
MasterSim is actively developed at the Technische Universität Dresden, Institut für Bauklimatik (see contact page).
</p>
<h2>Parts of MasterSim</h2>
<p>
MasterSim consists of three parts:
<ul>
<li>MasterSimulator command line executable</li>
<li>MasterSimulator user interface</li>
<li>MasterSim programming library</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why use MasterSim?</h2>
<p>
First of all, it is <b>free</b>! The complete source code is available on its [<a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mastersim">SourceForge-project page</a>] under
an open source license.</p>
<p>
But there are many other reasons for using MasterSim:
<ul>
<li>MasterSim is a cross-platform development, available for Windows, Linux and MacOS</li>
<li>Support for <i>scripted execution</i></li>
<li>Support for <i>several FMU instances</i> within the same co-simulation scenario</li>
<li>Highly <i>configurable master algorithms</i></li>
<li><i>Auto-connection feature</i> in user interface (very useful when connecting FMUs with many matching inputs and outputs)</li>
<li><i>Detailed simulation statistics</i> inform about where in your co-simulation is most of the simulation time spend; This is very helpful for performance tuning and selection of the optimal algorithm</li>
<li>Support for parallel executed variation studies (several MasterSimulator processes), where the same FMU file is used concurrently in several simulations running in parallel</li>
<li>Diagnostic options that assist FMU developers when <i>debugging their FMU code</i></li>
<li>Source code comes with few dependencies on other libraries (only C/C++ standard library and Qt for the user interface), which ensures long lifetime and compatibility for many platforms.</li>
<li>Software and code is <i>actively developed, used and maintained</i> at the Institut für Bauklimatik, TU Dresden</li>
</ul>
<p>Details about these features can be found on the [<a href="documentation.html">documentation page</a>] or on the SourceForge-project [<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mastersim/wiki/" target=_blank>WIKI-pages</a>].

<h1>MasterSim Software Library</h1>
<h2>Library Functionality</h2>
<p>
With the library you can implement co-simulation functionality into your own simulation
programs with little effort. 
<h3>FMU Import functionality</h3>
<p>
The library supports extraction of FMU archives, reading 
of <span style="font-family:monospace">modelDescription.xml</span> files, importing shared
library symbols into memory. This is all neatly encapsulated in corresponding classes.
<h3>Master-Algorithms</h3>
<p>
Included in the library source code are standard master algorithms, such 
as <i>Gauss-Jacobi</i>, <i>Gauss-Seidel</i> and <i>Newton</i>. They can be readily
used in own code without any work necessary (except for tuning of some numerical parameters, perhaps).

<h3>Best-practice guide and example code</h3>
<p>
The command line co-simulation solver <i>MasterSimulator</i> and the user interface code
can be used as guide and tutorial on how to write such code yourself.

<h2>Co-Simulation Standard Support</h2>
<p>The library supports currently the FMI Co-Simulation Standard 1.0 and 2.0. Some
of the algorithms (i.e. all algorithms that need setting back of FMU states) require
FMI v2.0, but <i>Gauss-Jacobi</i> and <i>Gauss-Seidel</i> work with FMU 1.0 as well.
