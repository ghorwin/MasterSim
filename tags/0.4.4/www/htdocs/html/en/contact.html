<h1>About the MasterSim Development...</h1>
<p>The development of MasterSim was started within the research project <b>EnTool:CoSim</b> funded by <i>Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)</i>. The code was written at the [<a href="https://tu-dresden.de/bu/architektur/ibk" target="_blank">Institut für Bauklimatik of the TU Dresden</a>. The project partners from [<a href="http://www.eas.iis.fraunhofer.de/" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IIT, EAS</a>] had already an implementation of a master algorithm, but that could not be made open source because of license restrictions. 
<p>For the development of Functional Mockup Units of our own room and building energy performance simulation models [<a href="http://www.bauklimatik-dresden.de/therakles" target="_blank">THERAKLES</a>] and [<a href="http://www.bauklimatik-dresden.de/nandrad" target="_blank">NANDRAD</a>] a new implementation was made from scratch. This open-source implementation was also provided to the [<a href="http://www.iea-annex60.org/" target="_blank">Annex 60</a>] community. 
<p>
During the implementation, some of the features needed for building energy simulation FMUs were added to the master, that are not available in other master implementations (particularly those that deal with FMU-own output data). Also, most software design decisions were documented on the SourceForge [<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mastersim/wiki/" target=_blank>WIKI-pages</a>], in order to understand the software architecture and code structure.
<p>
MasterSim is now actively used in the application phase of our research project and will be continuously enhanced (also based on the feedback collected via the SourceForge ticket system).
